# Data:  idiosyncrasies in the collected datasets

*This page is part of the [[documentation|Home]] on stats for the PLoS alt-metrics study.*

The raw data has the following known idiosyncrasies.  For the purposes of the PLoS alt-metrics study, these are handled in the stat code:

* the Facebook events include a few -1s
* the PLoS alt-metrics data includes a few NAs, because PLoS returns no alt-metrics data for a few articles
