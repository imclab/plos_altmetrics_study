March 3, 2012It is with great enthusiasm that we submit our manuscript, "Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact" to PLoS ONE and the PLoS altmetrics Collection.We performed a large-scale analysis of altmetrics and citation data on 24,331 PLoS articles, reporting activity levels, correlations, underlying factors, and exploratory cluster analysis.  To our knowledge, this is the largest analysis of its kind; we expect it to be a worthwhile contribution to the growing area of altmetrics research and scholarly impact metrics more generally.We recognize the initial date for contributions to the PLoS altmetrics Collection has passed.  Please do let us know if there is anything we can do to facilitate inclusion in the initial Collection release, if that is still possible -- we will make revisions quickly, for example.Thank you for this opportunity, and we look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely, Jason PriemHeather PiwowarBrad Hemminger
