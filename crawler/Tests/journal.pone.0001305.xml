Among the therapies considered for use in pandemic influenza is the co-administration of ion channel and neuraminidase inhibitors, both to potentially increase efficacy as well as to decrease the emergence of resistant isolates. To better understand the potential for drug interactions, a cross-over, randomized, open-label trial was conducted with amantadine, 100 mg po bid, and oseltamivir, 75 mg po bid, given alone or in combination for 5 days. Each subject (N = 17) served as their own control and was administered each drug alone or in combination, with appropriate wash-out. Co-administration with oseltamivir had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of amantadine [mean ratios (90% CI) for AUC<sub>0-12</sub> 0.93 (0.89, 0.98) and C<sub>max</sub> 0.96 (0.90, 1.02)]. Similarly, amantadine co-administration did not affect oseltamivir PK [AUC<sub>0-12</sub> 0.92 (0.86, 0.99) and C<sub>max</sub> 0.85 (0.73, 0.99)] or the PK of the metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate [AUC<sub>0-12</sub> 0.98 (0.95, 1.02) and C<sub>max</sub> 0.95 (0.89, 1.01)]. In this small trial there was no evidence of an increase in adverse events. Although many more subjects would need to be studied to rule out a synergistic increase in adverse events, the combination in this small human drug-drug interaction trial appears safe and without pharmacokinetic consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00416962" xlink:type="simple">NCT00416962</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The possible adaptation of avian influenza virus into an easily transmissible virus in humans, resulting in a potential pandemic of a magnitude not seen for nearly a century, has resulted in heightened awareness of influenza therapeutic options.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Beigel1">[1]</xref> Only two classes of compounds are presently licensed for the treatment or prophylaxis of epidemic seasonal influenza, the ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine (active only against influenza A) and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamavir.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Hayden1">[2]</xref> Due to the increased resistance of circulating seasonal influenza strains against amantadine, the intrinsic resistance of most H5N1 strains, and the rapid emergence of resistance to ion channel inhibitors, amantadine is not considered to be a first line agent for use in pandemic influenza disease resulting from potential human adaptation followed by sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 avian influenza.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Bright1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Hayden2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Ilyushina1">[5]</xref> Because of its oral availability, activity against most strains of H5N1, and extensive safety data, oseltamivir, a prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate, is considered the likely drug of choice for both treatment and prophylaxis for potential pandemic influenza at this time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Hayden2">[4]</xref></p><p>However, as the range of available treatment options has broadened, the use of combination antiviral therapy has become standard of care in the management of some viral diseases, most notably RNA virus such as HIV. Combination antiretroviral therapy has been shown to be associated with greater and more prolonged reduction in viral burden and with reduced and delayed emergence of resistance. As some strains of H5N1 influenza virus remain sensitive to amantadine, the question has arisen as to whether the use of the oseltamivir and amantadine in combination may not represent an additional approach to improve efficacy outcomes and to prevent the emergence of resistance to either drug. Recent WHO guidelines for the pharmacological management of avian influenza virus infection in humans recommended that where the virus is sensitive to amantadine, that combination use of oseltamivir with amantadine could be considered. (WHO/PSM/PAR/2006.6)</p><p>These two classes of drugs have different pharmacological mechanisms of action and it has been speculated that a combination of the two agents might improve efficacy outcomes or increase the resistance barriers. In vitro and animal data has shown that there is some basis for both of these considerations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Govorkova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Hayden3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Ilyushina2">[8]</xref> An <italic>in vitro</italic> study of the combination revealed that the use of this combination in H5N1 drug-sensitive viruses prevented amino acid substitutions in the HA, NA or M proteins using relatively low concentrations of oseltamivir combined with amantadine, whereas each single agent resulted in some mutations of variable decreased susceptibility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Ilyushina2">[8]</xref> A second study by the same group showed that the combination of drugs <italic>in vivo</italic> was more effective at lowering viral load and preventing clinical illness and mortality in mice infected with H5N1 than when either oseltamivir or amantadine was used alone (Ilyushina NA et al, Amantadine-oseltamivir combination therapy for H5N1 influenza virus infection in mice. Antiviral therapy, In press.)</p><p>Other combinations of drugs used against influenza have been studied with similar results.

There are no theoretical considerations, using the known drug metabolism or excretion pathways of either drug (noting that oseltamivir is the prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate), that lead to a prediction of meaningful pharmocological interactions. Nonetheless, the following trial was designed to provide some data in humans on the use of the drugs in combination, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of amantadine and oseltamivir administered alone and in combination.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001305.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001305.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 18 healthy subjects were to be enrolled, with replacement of drop-outs allowed.

with oseltamivir alone or in combination. One episode of mild upset stomach was associated with the combination, was mild, and resolved without treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many countries worldwide have stockpiled both amantadine and oseltamivir for use as either for prophylaxis or treatment of potential pandemic influenza. Guidelines have also been established by WHO for the treatment of persons infected with avian H5N1 influenza A virus, despite a dearth of information on the clinical effectiveness of the proposed recommendations. Included in these guidelines is the statement that “clinicians might administer a combination of a neuraminidase inhibitor and an M2 inhibitor if local surveillance data show that the H5N1 is known or likely to be susceptible”. There are, however, no data to support whether there may be an unanticipated drug-drug-interaction which might impact on the posology of such a combination.</p><p>Excretory and metabolic processes involved in clearance of amantadine and oseltamivir are different. Amantadine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, whereas oseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Aoki1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Doucette1">[14]</xref> Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.</p><p>As expected, coadministration with oseltamivir had no meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of amantadine. Similarly, amantadine coadministration did not meaningfully affect oseltamivir PK or the PK of metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Except for minor changes in oseltamivir C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub>, confidence intervals for geometric mean ratios of all other parameters were within bioequivalence criteria of 80–125%, and the difference observed for oseltamivir were not considered clinically meaningful as the point estimates were near unity and the study size was relatively small.</p><p>In a study conducted with amantadine, plasma acetylamantadine accounted for up to 80% of the concurrent amantadine plasma concentration in 5 of 12 healthy volunteers. Acetylamantadine was not detected in the plasma of the remaining seven volunteers (see Symmetrel® package insert) In the current study, acetylamantadine was not detected in the plasma of any of the seventeen volunteers that participated in this study. In another study, after 15 days of amantadine 100 mg b.i.d., the C<sub>max</sub> was 0.47±0.11 µg/mL in four of the five volunteers (Symmetrel® package insert). In this study we report a higher geometric mean of C<sub>max</sub> of 0.64 µg/mL after 5 days of amantadine 100 mg b.i.d and a geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> of 0.61 µg/mL when coadministered with oseltamivir.</p><p>Previously reported mean C<sub>max</sub> of 65.2 ng/mL was observed for oseltamivir and 348 ng/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate after twice daily oral dosing with 75 mg oseltamivir capsule (Oseltamivir package insert). In this study we report a geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> of 60.2 ng/mL for oseltamivir and 407.1 ng/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate following administration of 75 mg BID for five day. When co-administered with amantadine we observed geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> of 51.1 ng/mL for oseltamivir and 385.6 ng/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate. Mean AUC<sub>0-12</sub> values observed in this study (geometric mean of 161.3 ng.hr/mL for oseltamivir and 3429.1 ng.hr/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate) were also slightly higher than values reported earlier for oseltamivir (112 ng.hr/mL) and oseltamivir carboxylate (2719 ng.hr/mL). When co-administered with amantadine we report geometric mean AUC<sub>0-12</sub> of 148.6 ng.hr/mL for oseltamivir and 3369.3 ng.hr/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate.</p><p>The study did not have sufficient power to examine the potential increase in adverse events, especially those related to the CNS. Amantadine is well known to result in alteration of mental status, especially in the elderly, but that population was not studied here. The potential for a CNS interaction with neuraminidase inhibitors remains unproven, although a new precaution has recently been added to the US label of oseltamivir (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4254B_09_05-PI-clean-110906.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4254B_09_05-PI-clean-110906.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>Most H5N1 isolates have been resistant to amantadine. Recently, the H5N1 isolates have been grouped into two distinct clades and 3 subclades sub-lineages. These include the clade 1 strains that are insensitive to amantadine and the clade 2 viruses circulating in Indonesia which show an approximate 50% resistance to amantadine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Webster1">[15]</xref> It is not known if amantadine resistant viruses will persist or be replaced by fully susceptible strains (WHO report 2006). Recently, a subclade has been reported from China (Fujan), but the amantadine sensitivity of this strain is not yet clear.</p><p>Oseltamivir is effective against all strains of influenza A and B tested, including H5N1.</p><p>The neuraminidase of H5N1 appears to be have increased in sensitivity over time to NA inhibitors since these viruses emerged in 1997.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Hayden2">[4]</xref> Seasonal influenza strains have a low rate of resistance to oseltamivir-0.33% in adults and 4% in children, although some studies have reported higher rates in children who may have been underdosed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Ward1">[16]</xref> In patients with H5N1 infection viral load appears to be much higher than encountered in seasonal influenza, and a total of 3 cases have been reported where reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir was noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-deJong1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001305-Le1">[18]</xref> These results highlight not only the need to understand and administer the correct oseltamivir dosage as early as possible but also the need for continued vigilance in H5N1 infected patients and the need for additional antiviral agents or combinations.</p><p>Combination treatment in mice using equivalent human therapeutic doses of oseltamivir and amantadine against a lethal challenge of recombinant amantadine sensitive A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus protected 90% of the animals in contrast to dosing of each as a single agent where the mortality protection level was only 20% (Ilyushina, in press). No benefit of the combination was observed when infection was performed with an amantadine-resistant virus. The pharmacological basis for this beneficial combination of the two therapeutics might be explained by their targeting different viral proteins (NA and M2) , but this is not clear at this time.</p><p>In summary, the combination of amantadine and oseltamivir was without evidence of an increase in adverse events (although underpowered for this endpoint), and there was no clinically significant effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetic profile of the other. Data from this limited human volunteer study and the preliminary animal and in vitro data available on amantadine and oseltamivir indicate that it would be worthwhile to conduct further studies using such a combination.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0001305.s001" mimetype="application/pdf"
